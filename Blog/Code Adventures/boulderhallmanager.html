                    <h2>Boulder Hall Manager - Rotation Handles, Command Pattern & Outline Renderer</h2>
                    <p><em>Posted on 5-9-2023 at 03:12 am</em></p>

                    <p>It's 3 am, my circadian rhyth begins to shift, and I have some exciting updates to share with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>First, I've added "Undo" functionality to the program. To make this work seamlessly, I had to refactor my existing code to follow the Command Pattern. It took some time, but it's made the code more efficient and easier to expand. While
                        I've implemented "Undo," I haven't yet worked on the "Redo" function </p>

                    <p>Second, I've added rotation handles, fulfilling a promise (to whom, I'm not quite sure!). This feature was both straightforward and rewarding to implement. I don't have much to elaborate on here—it simply works as expected. </p>

                    <p>Third, I've added the ability to remove existing holds or grips. This was easier to implement than ever, thanks to the newly incorporated Command Pattern in the code.
                    </p>
                    <p>Last but not least, I've rolled out support for multiple colored outlines. I made adjustments to the shader to accommodate this feature. The objects requiring outlines are passed through an UV channel, with their color in the screen
                        render determining the outline color. Since no shadow data is passed through during these render calls, the meshes in the screen render are displayed in flat color which makes the line color consistent.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Boulder Hall Manager - Path Editor & Outline Renderer</h2>
                    <p><em>Posted on 4-9-2023 at 02:22 am</em></p>

                    <h4>Path Editor</h4>
                    <p>Hello, it's 2 am again, so you know what that means! Time to post an update about the latest changes I made to my management game. I made a programming interface for seperate paths, which are visualised by the outline. In the next
                        update I will probably add some handles for editing already placed grips.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Outline Shader</h4>
                    <p>As you can see I also implemented my own Outline shader, which took some hours to make. I don't have alot of experience creating shaders so this was a fun way to learn more about them and the unity render pipeline. In short I created
                        a custom post processing effect and passed a render texture which contains the meshes of objects that need to be rendered. After that I do some edge detection in the shader and sample 4 points around the center point of the shader
                        pass. The line width determines how far those points are from the center. For now I'm very happy with the results and what I learned</p>

                    <p>Basic creation features</p>
                    <p>Today I created a basic GUI for offering a few building features to the player, these features include placing and destructing wall segments and creating simple boulder routes with a selected difficulty/color</p>
                    <p>If have time again I will work on expanding the path/route creation</p>

                    <p>Here is a small POC (for myself) for creating a boulder track builder</p>
                    <p>I've been enjoying bouldering recently and a game concept of a boulder hall tycoon/manager is forming in my head, so I will try to create it in unity :)</p>
